###Distributed Genetic Algorithm
by _Josiah Hester, Ashley Anderson, Justin Reid_

This is our final project for CPSC 362 at Clemson University Computer Science.

This program is meant to be run distributed among multiple computers using Condor. Each computer on a network runs its own AI script (represented by a Zelda sprite) that lives, fights, and dies on custom made maps. The point is to model a genetic algorithm by combining attributes of all Zelda sprites who live, then repeat the experiment until an optimal set of attributes are found.
